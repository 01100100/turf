## nearestNeighborAnalysis

Nearest Neighbor Analysis calculates an index based the average distances
between points in the dataset, thereby providing inference as to whether the
data is clustered, dispersed, or randomly distributed within the study area.

It returns a [Feature&lt;Polygon>](Feature<Polygon>) of the study area, with the results of
the analysis attached as part of of the `nearestNeighborAnalysis` property
of the study area's `properties`.

The calculations for this function are found in:

Philip J. Clark and Francis C. Evans, “Distance to Nearest Neighbor as a
Measure of Spatial Relationships in Populations,” _Ecology_ 35, no. 4
(1954): 445–453, doi:[10.2307/1931034](http://doi.org/10.2307/1931034).

**Parameters**

-   `dataset` **[FeatureCollection](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#feature-collection-objects)&lt;[Point](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#point)>** FeatureCollection of points to study
-   `options` **[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** Optional parameters (optional, default `{}`)
    -   `options.studyAreaArea` **[number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)?** The area of the study area
    -   `options.units` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** unit of measurement for for distances and, squared, area. (optional, default `'kilometers'`)
    -   `options.properties` **[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** properties (optional, default `{}`)

**Examples**

```javascript
var bbox = [-65, 40, -63, 42];
var dataset = turf.randomPoint(100, { bbox: bbox });
var nearestNeighborStudyArea = turf.nearestNeighborAnalysis(dataset);

//addToMap
var addToMap = [dataset, nearestNeighborStudyArea];
```

Returns **[Feature](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#feature-objects)&lt;[Polygon](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#polygon)>** A polygon of the study area or an approximation of one.
