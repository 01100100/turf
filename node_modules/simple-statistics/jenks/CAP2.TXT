CLASSY for WINDOWS has a long trail of contributors.  The concept of applying minimum variance techniques to choropleth map classing originated with George F. Jenks at the University of Kansas in the late 1960s.  Jenks originally used an "iteration" technique that temporarily "moved" data values between classes and then calculated for minimum variance within each class.  He later adopted an algorithm from W. D. Fisher and John A. Hartigan that automatically calculated minimum variance classes in one pass of the data.  Jenks wrote FORTRAN code for the program on a mainframe in the mid-1970s.  This program was later rewritten in BASIC for Tektronix and IBM-PC machines by Richard E. Groop at Michigan State University.  Modifications were added by J. Michael Lipsey, Robert Brewer and James B. Moore.  Moore rewrote the current DOS version of CLASSY in 1985.  CLASSY for WINDOWS builds on all of the above work.  Major modifications have been made to the current DOS version.
